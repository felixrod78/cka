Generate an `htpasswd` File and Store It as a Secret
htpasswd -c .htpasswd user

Create a secret called nginx-htpasswd, and store the contents of the htpasswd file in that Secret. Delete the htpasswd file once the Secret is created.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: nginx-htpasswd
type: Opaque
data:
  username: user
  password: $apr1$9Jkw4tpZ$OGOxMtzmec7OWyeuA11k01 (debe estar en base64)


Create a pod with a single container using the nginx:1.19.1 image.

The Nginx configuration is stored in an existing ConfigMap called nginx-config. Mount the ConfigMap to /etc/nginx in your pod.

Mount your htpasswd secret to /etc/nginx/conf within your pod. The htpasswd data should be in a file in the container at /etc/nginx/conf/.htpasswd.

Expose containerPort 80 on the Nginx container so you can communicate with it to test your setup.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.19.1
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      volumeMounts:
      -  name: configmap-volume
         mountPath: /etc/nginx
      -  name: secret-volume
         mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf
  volumes:
    - name: configmap-volume
      configMap:
        name: nginx-config
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: nginx-htpasswd
